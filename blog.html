                sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

Global Variables  A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

Local Variables  A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable.

Variables: It holds the data or information which can be changed anytime. JavaScript use reserved keyword var to declare variables. In JavaScript, there are two types of variable and also it tells you where in your program you are allowed to use the variables and functions that youâ€™ve defined.

Local Variable:
When you use JavaScript, local variables are variables that are defined within functions. They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them.

Global Variable:
In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions. These variables have global scope, so they can be used by any function without passing them to the function as parameters.

                JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

                Runtime concepts
                The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily optimize the described semantics.

                JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language. But what does it actually mean? What is this event loop in JavaScript that we all keep talking about? 

                What does it actually mean when we say JavaScript is single threaded?

               It means that the main thread where JavaScript code is run, runs in one line at a time manner and there is no possibility of running code in parallel.

                1.templet string is an ES6 components  

                2. a template literal is just like a better version of a regular         JavaScript string. 
                
                3. The substitutions allow you to embed variables and expressions in a string. The JavaScript engine will automatically      replacethese     variables and expressions with their values. This feature is known as string interpolation. 
                
                4. A template tag carries the transformation on the template literal and returns the result string. 
                
                You place the tag at the beginning of the template before the backtick (`) character as follows: 
                
                5. Use the backtick to create a string literal for string interpolation.
