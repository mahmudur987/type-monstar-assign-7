                sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

                1.Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that particular tab.
                2.A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page reloads and restores.
                3.Opening a page in a new tab or window creates a new session with the value of the top-level browsing context, which differs from how session cookies work.
                4. Opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each tab/window.
                5.Duplicating a tab copies the tab's sessionStorage into the new tab.
                6.Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in sessionStorage.

            The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

            Global Variables  A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

           Local Variables  A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

           Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable.

           Variables: It holds the data or information which can be changed anytime. JavaScript use reserved keyword var to declare variables. In JavaScript, there are two types of variable and also it tells you where in your program you are allowed to use the variables and functions that youâ€™ve defined.

          Local Variable:
          When you use JavaScript, local variables are variables that are defined within functions. They have local scope, which means that they can only be used within the functions that define them.

          Global Variable:
          In contrast, global variables are variables that are defined outside of functions. These variables have global scope, so they can be used by any function without passing them to the function as parameters.

                Question-3 : what is the java sccript event loop?

                JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

                Runtime concepts
                The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily optimize the           described semantics.

                JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language. But what does it actually mean? What is this event loop in JavaScript that we all keep talking about? 

                What does it actually mean when we say JavaScript is single threaded?

               It means that the main thread where JavaScript code is run, runs in one line at a time manner and there is no possibility of running code in parallel.

            1.variable that is not initialized will give undefine
            2.function with no return
            3.paramiter thatb is not passed will be undefined

            4. if return has nothing  on th right side will return undefine.
            5.property that doesnt exists on an obnject will  giive yu undefined
            6.accessing array element outside ofb vthe index range
            7.deleteing an element inside an arrayy
            8.set  a value directly to undefine
